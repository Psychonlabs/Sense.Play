Intuner is an interactive installation where the brain signals are translated into visuals patterns  and colours in real time using EEG headband.

The Aim of the installation is to show the various states of relaxation/concentration/Meditation by means of visual representation of the signals.

This installation was done using Touchdesigner and 1st gen Muse EEG headband and MindMoniter App via OSC connection.

This is achieved as a first proof of concept for Senseplay ecosystem and its core technological stack.


# Sense.Play
World's only affective gaming dev board that helps build applications that delivers visual feedback of a person's emotional indices in affective gaming, mental wellness apps, games, guided meditation, and all forms of recreational biofeedback.   

Play games using your biological signals to train for mindfulness, relaxation, or use as a professional tool to improve concentration and performance.

Design & Specs

HRV Sensor
High-accuracy digital pulse oximetry sensor for Heart rate variability measurement

GSR Sensor

For measuring the speed of responses from the autonomic nervous system in real-time, which is an important indicator of our bodies stress level.
Modular Design

Snap-Fit modular design to make the device compatible with the maximum number of smartphones in the market which comes in varied sizes.

LED feedback

Real-time LED feedback from the device helps userâ€™s to be aware of their current state through the emotional indices measured by the sensor.

SDK & Developer Kit
Senseplay SDK allows developers to build apps, games and experiences to be built using the real-time signals from the sensors.



Affective games

Senseplay SDK is made to support game engines like Unity, Unreal for developers to create affective games.


We fabricated our own sensor board with a form factor to suit this purpose and we are working on the next iteration of the design for it to be 3d printed.
